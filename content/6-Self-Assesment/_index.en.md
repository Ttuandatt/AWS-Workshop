During my internship at AMAZON WEB SERVICES VIETNAM COMPANY LIMITED from 08/09/2025 to 09/12/2025, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.

In the backend domain, I strengthened my ability to: 
- Develop RESTful APIs
- Work with Microservices Architecture
- Effectively utilize various AWS services 

I also gained practical experience in designing AWS architectures that are scalable, secure, and cost-optimized for real-world projects.

During this period, I also:
- Strengthened my teamwork skills

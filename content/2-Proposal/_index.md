# Multi-Region SaaS Task Management Platform

A Global AWS Solution for Low-Latency, Resilient Collaboration

1. Executive Summary

The Multi-Region SaaS Task Management Platform is designed to deliver a Trello/Asana-like experience with low latency and high availability for users across the US, EU, and Asia. Built with Spring Boot microservices and Aurora MySQL as the core database, the platform supports real-time collaboration, board/task management, and notifications.

By leveraging AWS Multi-Region services, the system provides:

Low-latency reads using Aurora Global Database read replicas.

High availability with regional failover strategies.

Global access via CloudFront, Route 53, and S3 replication.

Optional active-active metadata with DynamoDB Global Tables.

The solution ensures that users can continue working seamlessly, even during regional outages, while maintaining predictable costs and operational efficiency.

2. Problem Statement

What’s the Problem?
Traditional SaaS task management platforms often run in a single region, which creates:

High latency for users outside the main region (e.g., EU/Asia users connecting to US).

Risk of downtime if the primary region fails.

Complexity in scaling for global collaboration.

The Solution
A multi-region architecture on AWS that uses:

Aurora Global Database for consistent data with global reads.

ECS Fargate clusters running Spring Boot microservices per region.

Route 53 latency-based routing to serve users from the closest region.

S3 + CloudFront for static content and user file storage with cross-region replication.

EventBridge/SNS/Lambda for global event propagation (notifications, background jobs).

This hybrid approach combines reliability, performance, and global scalability while keeping Aurora MySQL as the core datastore.

Benefits and ROI

Reduced latency for global users.

Improved reliability with disaster recovery playbooks.

Demonstrates enterprise-ready SaaS capabilities for multi-region scale.

Cost-effective compared to building a fully active-active database system.

3. Solution Architecture
Architecture Overview

Microservices: Auth, Board, Task, Notification – deployed on ECS Fargate in each region.

Database: Aurora Global Database – single writer (US), multiple read replicas (EU, Asia).

Storage: S3 buckets with Cross-Region Replication + CloudFront for global edge caching.

Routing: Route 53 latency-based DNS + health checks for regional failover.

Events: EventBridge/SNS/Lambda for propagating domain events across regions.

Optional: DynamoDB Global Tables for active-active metadata (notifications, activity feed).

AWS Services Used

Aurora MySQL Global Database – single-writer, multi-reader setup.

ECS Fargate – containerized Spring Boot services per region.

Amazon S3 + CloudFront – static assets and file storage with CRR.

Route 53 – latency-based routing and health checks.

Amazon ECR – container registry with cross-region replication.

Secrets Manager – multi-region replicated credentials.

EventBridge/SNS/Lambda – event-driven cross-region sync.

CloudWatch & X-Ray – monitoring and tracing.

Component Design

Application Layer: Spring Boot microservices (REST APIs) deployed per region.

Database Layer: Aurora Global Database (writer in US, read replicas in EU/Asia).

File Layer: S3 buckets with CRR + presigned uploads.

Routing Layer: Route 53 + ALB/API Gateway per region.

User Layer: Clients connect to nearest region, reads are local, writes forwarded to primary.

4. Technical Implementation

Implementation Phases (8 weeks)

Planning (Week 0)

Choose primary (us-east-1) and secondary regions (eu-west-1, ap-southeast-1).

Finalize VPC design, domain, and S3 bucket naming.

Phase 1: MVP (Weeks 1–3)

Deploy core microservices (Auth, Board, Task) in primary region.

Aurora MySQL single-cluster as DB.

S3 + CloudFront for frontend hosting.

CI/CD pipeline for build, ECR push, ECS deploy.

Phase 2: Multi-Region Expansion (Weeks 4–5)

Convert Aurora to Global Database, add read replicas.

Deploy ECS clusters in EU & Asia.

Route 53 latency-based routing enabled.

Configure S3 CRR.

Phase 3: Cross-Region Events & Failover (Weeks 6–7)

EventBridge/SNS cross-region event propagation.

Secrets Manager & ECR replication.

Runbook for Aurora promotion in failover scenarios.

Phase 4: Testing & Demo (Week 8)

End-to-end latency tests.

Failover simulation.

Documentation & demo.

5. Timeline & Milestones

Month 1: Core MVP in US (Auth, Board, Task, S3, CloudFront, Aurora).

Month 2: Multi-region expansion (Aurora Global DB, ECS in EU/Asia, Route 53).

Month 3: Event propagation, monitoring, failover testing, final demo.

6. Budget Estimation

Estimated Monthly Costs (based on AWS Pricing Calculator):

Aurora MySQL Global Database: ~$350/month.

ECS Fargate (3 regions, ~4 services): ~$200/month.

S3 + CloudFront: ~$30/month.

Route 53 (DNS + health checks): ~$5/month.

ECR replication: ~$10/month.

EventBridge/SNS/Lambda: ~$20/month.

Monitoring (CloudWatch/X-Ray): ~$15/month.

Total: ~$630/month (~$7,500/year).
Costs can be reduced by limiting regions or optimizing cluster sizes.

7. Risk Assessment

Risk Matrix

Aurora failover lag → Medium impact, Low probability.

Cross-region network latency → Medium impact, High probability.

Cost overruns → High impact, Medium probability.

Mitigation Strategies

Failover playbooks tested regularly.

Design UI with optimistic updates to handle lag.

Enable AWS budget alerts.

Contingency Plans

Promote Aurora secondary region manually during primary outage.

Use DynamoDB Global Tables for critical metadata if replication lag is an issue.

Reduce active regions if costs exceed expectations.

8. Expected Outcomes

Technical Improvements

Low-latency access for global users.

High availability and disaster recovery readiness.

Real-time collaboration features.

Long-Term Value

Scalable architecture for enterprise SaaS use cases.

Demonstrates multi-region design pattern for future projects.

Provides foundation for advanced analytics and ML integrations.

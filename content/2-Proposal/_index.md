# Multi-Region SaaS Task Management Platform

## A Global AWS Solution for Low-Latency, Resilient Collaboration

### 1. Executive Summary

The Multi-Region SaaS Task Management Platform is designed to deliver a Trello/Asana-like experience with low latency and high availability for users across the US, EU, and Asia. Built with Spring Boot microservices and Aurora MySQL as the core database, the platform supports real-time collaboration, board/task management, and notifications.

By leveraging AWS Multi-Region services, the system provides:

- Low-latency reads using Aurora Global Database read replicas.

- High availability with regional failover strategies.

- Global access via CloudFront, Route 53, and S3 replication.

- Optional active-active metadata with DynamoDB Global Tables.

The solution ensures that users can continue working seamlessly, even during regional outages, while maintaining predictable costs and operational efficiency.

### 2. Problem Statement

**2.1. What’s the Problem?**

Traditional SaaS task management platforms typically operate in a single region, which leads to performance and reliability challenges. Users outside the primary region, such as those in Europe or Asia connecting to a US-based deployment, experience high latency. There is also a single point of failure if the primary region experiences downtime, which affects availability. Furthermore, scaling these platforms for global collaboration becomes complex without a distributed architecture.

**2.2. The Solution**

This project proposes a multi-region architecture on AWS designed for global SaaS task management. The solution leverages Aurora Global Database to ensure strong consistency and low-latency reads across regions, while ECS Fargate clusters run Spring Boot microservices independently per region to provide localized processing. Route 53 latency-based routing directs users to the nearest regional deployment, and S3 with CloudFront ensures fast delivery of static content and user files through cross-region replication. Global event propagation is managed with EventBridge, SNS, and Lambda for notifications and background jobs. This hybrid design achieves reliability, performance, and scalability while maintaining Aurora MySQL as the central datastore.

**2.3. Benefits and Return on Investment**

The architecture reduces latency for a distributed user base, ensuring faster response times for global teams. It increases reliability with built-in disaster recovery and failover capabilities, minimizing downtime risks. By adopting this design, the platform demonstrates enterprise-ready SaaS capabilities at a multi-region scale, making it attractive for organizations requiring high availability. The approach remains cost-effective compared to building a fully active-active database system, providing a strong balance between performance and operational costs.

### 3. Solution Architecture

**3.1. Architecture Overview**

- Microservices: Auth, Board, Task, Notification – ECS Fargate per region.

- Database: Aurora Global Database – single writer (US), multi-reader (EU, Asia).

- Cache: ElastiCache Redis clusters per region for session and frequently accessed data.

- Storage: S3 buckets with CRR + CloudFront for global edge caching.

- Routing & Security: Route 53 + ALB/API Gateway per region + CloudFront with AWS WAF.

- Events: EventBridge/SNS/Lambda for domain event propagation.

- Optional: DynamoDB Global Tables for active-active metadata.

**3.2. AWS Services Used**

- Aurora MySQL Global Database – single-writer, multi-reader setup.

- ECS Fargate – containerized Spring Boot services per region.

- Amazon S3 + CloudFront – static assets and file storage with CRR.

- Route 53 – latency-based routing and health checks.

- Amazon ECR – container registry with cross-region replication.

- Secrets Manager – multi-region replicated credentials.

- EventBridge/SNS/Lambda – event-driven cross-region sync.

- CloudWatch & X-Ray – monitoring and tracing.

- AWS WAF – web application firewall, attached to CloudFront and ALB.

- ElastiCache (Redis) – caching layer for session, hot data, and notification feeds.

**3.3. Component Design**

- Application Layer: Spring Boot microservices (REST APIs).

- Database Layer: Aurora Global Database.

- Caching Layer: ElastiCache Redis per region to reduce Aurora read load and speed up session/task retrieval.

- File Layer: S3 buckets with CRR + presigned uploads.

- Routing Layer: Route 53 + CloudFront (with WAF) + ALB/API Gateway.

- User Layer: Clients connect to nearest region, reads from cache or local Aurora replica, writes forwarded to primary Aurora writer.

### 4. Technical Implementation

Implementation Phases (8 weeks)

**4.1. Planning (Week 0)**

-  Choose primary (us-east-1) and secondary regions (eu-west-1, ap-southeast-1).

- Finalize VPC design, domain, and S3 bucket naming.

**4.2. Phase 1: MVP (Weeks 1–3)**

- Deploy core microservices (Auth, Board, Task) in primary region.

- Aurora MySQL single-cluster as DB.

- S3 + CloudFront for frontend hosting.

- CI/CD pipeline for build, ECR push, ECS deploy.

**4.3. Phase 2: Multi-Region Expansion (Weeks 4–5)**

- Convert Aurora to Global Database, add read replicas.

- Deploy ECS clusters in EU & Asia.

- Route 53 latency-based routing enabled.

- Configure S3 CRR.

**4.4. Phase 3: Cross-Region Events & Failover (Weeks 6–7)**

- EventBridge/SNS cross-region event propagation.

- Secrets Manager & ECR replication.

- Runbook for Aurora promotion in failover scenarios.

**4.5. Phase 4: Testing & Demo (Week 8)**

- End-to-end latency tests.

- Failover simulation.

- Documentation & demo.

### 5. Timeline & Milestones
 
- Month 1: Core MVP in US (Auth, Board, Task, S3, CloudFront, Aurora).

- Month 2: Multi-region expansion (Aurora Global DB, ECS in EU/Asia, Route 53).

- Month 3: Event propagation, monitoring, failover testing, final demo.

### 6. Budget Estimation

Estimated Monthly Costs (based on AWS Pricing Calculator):

Aurora MySQL Global Database: ~$350/month.

ECS Fargate (3 regions, ~4 services): ~$200/month.

S3 + CloudFront: ~$30/month.

Route 53 (DNS + health checks): ~$5/month.

ECR replication: ~$10/month.

EventBridge/SNS/Lambda: ~$20/month.

Monitoring (CloudWatch/X-Ray): ~$15/month.

Total: ~$630/month (~$7,500/year).
Costs can be reduced by limiting regions or optimizing cluster sizes.

### 7. Risk Assessment

- Risk Matrix

    + Aurora failover lag → Medium impact, Low probability.

    + Cross-region network latency → Medium impact, High probability.

    + Cost overruns → High impact, Medium probability.

- Mitigation Strategies

    + Failover playbooks tested regularly.

    + Design UI with optimistic updates to handle lag.

    + Enable AWS budget alerts.

- Contingency Plans

    + Promote Aurora secondary region manually during primary outage.

    + Use DynamoDB Global Tables for critical metadata if replication lag is an issue.

    + Reduce active regions if costs exceed expectations.

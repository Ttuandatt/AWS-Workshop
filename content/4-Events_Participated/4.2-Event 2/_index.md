# Summary Report: “AWS Cloud Mastery Series #3 – Security Pillar Workshop”

### Event Objectives

* Understand the Security Pillar in the AWS Well-Architected Framework
* Learn core principles: **Least Privilege, Zero Trust, Defense in Depth**
* Practice managing IAM, Detection, Infrastructure Protection, Data Protection, and Incident Response
* Learn how to apply tools, playbooks, and automation to secure cloud systems
* Enhance security skills for AWS applications and infrastructure

### Key Highlights

#### Identity & Access Management (IAM)

* Users, Roles, Policies – avoid long-term credentials
* IAM Identity Center: SSO, permission sets
* SCP & permission boundaries for multi-account environments
* MFA, credential rotation, Access Analyzer
* Mini Demo: Validate IAM Policy + simulate access

#### Detection & Continuous Monitoring

* CloudTrail (organization-level), GuardDuty, Security Hub
* Logging at all layers: VPC Flow Logs, ALB/S3 logs
* Alerting & automation with EventBridge
* Detection-as-Code (infrastructure + rules)

#### Infrastructure Protection

* VPC segmentation, private vs public placement
* Security Groups vs NACLs
* WAF + Shield + Network Firewall
* Workload protection: EC2, ECS/EKS security basics

#### Data Protection

* Encryption, KMS, key policies, grants, rotation
* Encryption at-rest & in-transit: S3, EBS, RDS, DynamoDB
* Secrets Manager & Parameter Store – rotation patterns
* Data classification & access guardrails

#### Incident Response

* IR Playbook & Automation: compromised IAM key, S3 public exposure, EC2 malware detection
* Snapshot, isolation, evidence collection
* Auto-response using Lambda / Step Functions

### Key Takeaways
